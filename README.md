# US Airline Tweets Sentiment

## Goal
The goals of this project is to understand the main reason behind the negative tweet about different airlines and build a sentiment prediction model for tweets.

## Dataset
In this project, I will utilize the publicly available dataset (Twitter US Airline Sentiment) on Kaggle. You can access the dataset in two ways: manually downloading from the Kaggle website or using the Kaggle API.

### Option 1: Manual Download
1. Go to the Kaggle dataset page: [Kaggle Dataset URL]([https://www.kaggle.com/your-dataset-url](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/crowdflower/twitter-airline-sentiment/data)).
2. Click on the "Download" button to download the dataset.
3. Extract the downloaded files and place them in the appropriate directory in your project.

### Option 2: Using Kaggle API
1. Ensure you have the Kaggle API installed. If not, install it using:
   ```bash
   pip install kaggle

First, I performed EDA to analyze and summarize some of the main characteristics of the dataset and get some insights about it. 
Second, I have build a sentiment prediction model using XGBoost algorithm and DistilBERT llm.
