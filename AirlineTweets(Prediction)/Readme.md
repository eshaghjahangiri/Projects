# US Airline Tweets Sentiment

The goals of this project is to understand the main reason behind the negative tweet about different airlines and build a sentiment prediction model for tweets.

In this project, I will utilize the publicly available dataset (Twitter US Airline Sentiment) on Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/crowdflower/twitter-airline-sentiment/data).

First, I performed EDA to analyze and summarize some of the main characteristics of the dataset and get some insights about it. 
Second, I have build a sentiment prediction model using XGBoost algorithm and DistilBERT llm.
